I got in my car and drove off, and as I was driving away I saw all the doctors and medical personnel streaming out of the building. Some were running others were walking. As I got on the loop it looked like Police with lights and sirens were headed that direction. I’m not sure if it was a drill, but it was scary. 

Does anyone know anything or have any updates?"

I alerted the waitress. She seemed concerned and asked if I wanted a new meal, and also suggested replacing the fries. I told her the sandwich was fine, and a fresh order of fries would be sufficient. It seemed like the easiest solution, considering I didn't want to derail the other two people's lunch, I was with. So, off to the kitchen she goes. A couple minutes later she returns with an empty plate and asks me to put my sandwich on the plate and she will remove the fries. OK, kind of odd, since I already had removed the contaminated fry, which she had taken. Anyway, a couple minutes passes and she returns with what appear to be the same fries, just put back in the grease and completely overcooked. I thought it odd the way the thing was handled, so I filled out the customer feedback, on their website. Here is their response

""Thank you for your patience while we investigated this matter. We have visited with the team members that were involved with your experience and thoroughly reviewed the details. Under closer inspection in the kitchen, the ""hair"" was determined to be a thin piece of cheese that had been pulled off the sandwich when plating.  All the team members in the back of the house(3), where the lighting is brighter than in the dining room, concurred that it was cheese. The team member in the kitchen then dropped a new set of wedge fries and plated them for service, which is our standard when replacing any side item. We make a new one.   We did not ""redrop"" the existing wedge fries. We never put item, of any type, back in the fryer once it has been prepared. Your original fries were placed directly in the trash by the server. Wedge fries are a freshly prepared item in house, from whole   
potatoes, and can look very similar and have varying colors to them based on starch/sugar content.  So, perhaps, your fresh second order was from a potato that had more starch in it when cooked, thus darker. I hope this clears up any misunderstanding of what occurred and how it was handled. Thank you for your support of our restaurant and team. brett's 

That is some true revisionist history. There were two other people, at the table, who witnessed it. Additionally, the waitress confirmed what I saw, as she saw it. Four people were standing there looking at it, yet no one said it was cheese. But... it was the bad lighting.

How would the cheese get between the coating, of the fry, and the potato, if it just fell off the sandwich?  Since it was fried into the coating, had it been cheese it would have cooked away.

All Brett's responses are bunk and classless, to blame me, and my companions, as not being able to see what was clearly right in front of us. The attempt to gaslight is rich. ""Don't believe your lying eyes"". The whole way it was handled and their obvious willingness, to absolutely lie and libel their customers, says a lot about what a garbage restaurant it is. 0/10 Would not recommend."

Y’all Means All: Athens’ Future LGBT+ Community 🏳️‍🌈,0,1d4sprh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1d4sprh/yall_means_all_athens_future_lgbt_community/,38,2024-05-31 06:49:52,"(TLDR at bottom)

 have been putting off making this post for a couple of months, but with the annual parade (and the start of Pride month) tomorrow, now is better than ever.

To my knowledge, and simply connecting the dots, Athens has a few major reasons for its unusually high  queer population: the music/hipster mecca, being a college town, and both of these combined making it notable on lists of “gay-friendly” areas in the south, in Georgia, and in as a “mini”/mid-size alternative to those who do not want to live in major cities.

With that being said, how do you all envision this influx of people further encapsulating this dynamic? As I said in my post predicting the future of Athens, by the time Pride 2034 comes around, the Classic City will then be home to a SIGNIFICANTLY increased group of professionals who work in bio-tech and medical research, a considerably increased student population, and after that we will have the WFH segment, those moving to be in a warm area/college-town/mid-size city from all over, not to mention the government, academia, and service sectors expanding to match the aforementioned. Keep in mind, all of this is happening concurrently to Atlanta’s metropolitan area growing dramatically as well, including the suburbs that both it and Athens share, like Jackson, Barrow, and Oconee.

Coming from Atlanta, I fit more into the indie/punk gay scene here than the more glitzy, tribe-focused, and “mainstream” gay scene in Midtown. With that being said, I wish Church was not the “de facto” gay bar? I understand Athens, like Asheville, Boulder, Austin, and the other über-liberal areas around the country, has been accepting of “otherness” from the start, making the need for gay enclaves unnecessary, and I am ABSOLUTELY grateful for that. However, I wish there were at least a cluster of bars/clubs/venues, even if a single strip.

Even though the owner of Church is deplorable, that niche seems to only thrive there for some reason: dance bar for alternative/queer/edgy townies AND UGA kids. That bar is always wall-to-wall, line in the street PACKED. The other “townie” bars do not have the high-energy, dance party feel, and the dance bars on the other side of the Khaki line do not have much of the “I’m here and I’m queer!” and avant-garde/counterculture element. For those who remember Boneshaker’s, maybe you can give guesses as to why it did not remain open? Again, Church seems like it has a type of demand that none of the other bars, has, and that one MASSIVE crowd could be spread out into a few neighboring bars offering complementary experiences. 

My predictions, based on my experiences in major cities with high concentrations of gay male, as that is what I am familiar with firsthand, nightlife, is a cluster of a FEW explicitly “gay” bars. Likely four (4) to five (5): think a club, a cocktail bar, maybe a bear bar (Woof’s, Eagle, etc.) and the other two (2) having a similar premise to what Church is. The only question is just WHERE, exactly…

To anyone familiar with bio-tech as a “culture”, what does that entail as far as nightlife? I know that “tech bros” have shaped the culture of cities with large technology sectors, but bio-tech is by nature more niche, more affiliated with life sciences, and concentrated in very specific “hubs”, which Athens, like many other college towns, has had its share of, but this is different: this is a BOOM of people arriving en-masse.

With several hundred, maybe more than one thousand (1,000) transplants filling the specialist jobs at Meissner, the School of Medicine, Boehringer-Ingelheim, as well as the existing startup culture that substantially grows via the trailing spouses and the combined talent pool, I imagine that group will almost immediately make waves and alter the existing dynamics, but again, what will that look like?

TLDR; As Athens rapidly grows and evolves, how will the new segments/types of people that move in change the LGBT+ scene/culture? Athens has a grit, edge, and “DIY-quality” that defines its gay scene; how will an influx of more “conventional” bio-tech scientists and researchers alter this?"

I am a huge fan of the B-52s and I am just happening to find myself in Athens this weekend for a short random trip while visiting in-laws nearby.  Aside from the Athens Music walk, where are the best places to find B-52s-themed activities & sights around the city?  

I will only be there for about 24 hours but I will be staying in a hotel (haven’t picked one yet).  I am hoping to find hotels, bars, restaurants, or interesting landmarks that perhaps have B-52s references, photos, murals, etc.  Nothing fancy, just the normal stuff you would expect to see in a city paying homage to one of its most well-known artists.  Do such things exist?  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  Thank you!"

Writing stories about Oconee County until I make some friends here ,28,1d28d6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1d28d6p/writing_stories_about_oconee_county_until_i_make/,40,2024-05-27 21:59:29,"This is the first of a series of stories I plan on telling about my time in Oconee County until I find like minded friends.  I can't find anyone in Oconee County to be friends with.  It's been tough.

My wife and I lived in Clarke County for around 15 years.  We had our first child in 2015, a baby girl.  In 2022 we tried to purchase a house in Clarke County only to find ourselves outbid every single time.  A property in Oconee County fell into our laps at an incredible price point.  We were lucky enough to get it and felt very optimistic about the prospect of living in Oconee County.

We enrolled our daughter into a nearby school that had really good reviews.  Everyone seemed to love it.  What we found is that our daughter got an amazing education but socially was falling behind.  Our family is a bit free spirited.  We go with the flow and lean pretty left.  We have plenty of friends elsewhere that are conservative so it's never an issue for us.

Last year my daughter was having a tough time with a boy in her class.  At recess one day she got into an altercation with this boy.  This boy proceeded to grab her by her throat and punch her multiple times.  We received word from the school and picked her up.  She was obviously very shaken up and didn't end up going to school the next day either.  She was pretty traumatized.  It was close to the end of the school year so we let her stay out as much as we could.

That week, my wife and I went to school and talked to the Principal about this situation.  The Principal said that everything would be taken care of.  The boys parents had been notified and they were taking the situation very seriously.

That school year our daughter had become close with another teacher at the school who taught the next grade up.  We specifically requested that our daughter got that teacher going into the new grade and to not be in the same class as this boy.  The Principal said she would make this happen.

Summer went on as usual.  It was pretty lonely as we just didn't have very many friends.

Fast forward to the next years orientation.  My daughter did in fact get the teacher she wanted.  Excited, we went to the school to meet with the new teacher. 

We walked into the class and met with what was supposed to be my daughter's new teacher.  This new teacher showed us where my daughter would be sitting.  The desks had name tags so you could see where everyone was supposed to sit.  My daughter went to her seat and I looked at her desk mate.  It was the boy that had abused her.

My daughter instantly started crying.  She was very upset that she was going to have to share a desk clump with this boy.  I tried to calm her down and then explained the situation to the teacher.  The teacher said she did not know of this situation.  The teacher said she would contact the Principal so we could weigh our options.

That day my wife and I spoke to the Principal on the phone.  We asked why this boy was in her class when we had specifically requested him not to be?  Further, why was he assigned to sit right next to our daughter?

The excuses flew and they really did not have any good answers.  My wife and I were very frustrated with the entire situation.  We requested that they fix this situation so my daughter could feel safe in the class room.  The Principal said that they could not move the boy but could put our daughter into a new class instead.  This made our daughter very sad because she had already developed a relationship with the teacher she wanted.

We really didn't know what else we could do.  In our minds the right thing to do would be to move the boy to another class.  After stating our point over and over we were just hitting a brick wall.  We eventually caved and explained to our daughter that she had to have a new teacher.  This really made her upset.

Whether this is true across the board in Oconee County or not I don't know -- but it showed me something:  This particular school does not care about the safety of their students, specifically girls.  I've seen multiple instances of bullying go unchecked at this school.  Not sure if this is widespread or not.

As heartbreaking as this was our daughter had a pretty decent school year with her new teacher.  As an 8 year old she was still pretty confused on why she didn't get the teacher she wanted.  

That concludes story number one on Oconee County.  I have plenty more and will continue the series when time allows.

If you're in Oconee County (or Clarke!) and want some friends to hang with, DM me!  We would love to meet more folks that are similar to us.  I know there are others in Oconee County who feel the same way as we do."

I will be arriving tomorrow in Athens and I will stay here for 6 days. I booked this trip super impulsively 2 days ago and I thought to myself, maybe it would be nice to go to an island nearby Athens for maybe 1 or 2 day(s) and then go back to athens

Is this something you guys would recommend? Im kind of suffering from fear of missing out so im finding it hard to make a decision for myself hence is why im making this post

  
So my question is, Is going to another island for 1/2 days for some relaxation during my visit in Athens recommended? Or is there so much to do in Athens that I should just spent all my time in Athens. Also, if I would go to an island near Athens which island would you guys recommend."

I'm a full time student. In your guys experience, what is the likelihood of excusal vs deferral? Because if I was deferred to next year, then I'd be in BIG trouble.

Edit: 

Why I'm asking about this is because I'm doing 12 credit hours this summer and 18 credit hours Fall and Spring. Next summer I'd be doing an REU though, which would be how I pay for my food for the year. REU's are also really important for chances of getting into graduate school. So I didn't want to defer until I wasn't considered an active full time student and get pulled away from my REU. It's not like an internship, it's just a 2 - 3 month research opportunity with a bunch of concomitant classes. And, if you've taken 12 credit hours during the summer or 18 during regular semester where they're all STEM classes, you might understand what I mean when I say it's not an option to do jury duty simultaneously."

Looking for my grandmother's beloved jacket $300 REWARD,73,1czvsg2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1czvsg2,40,2024-05-24 17:26:21,"This jacket is at the heart of many a good memory between us. From my childhood to now. It's as precious to me as it is her.  Please, someone out there has to find it.

Missing: Women's large periwinkle blue trench coat with a purplish tinge, London Fog, postman style, originally hooded (hood now missing), 3/4 length, no belt. Purchased from a Sears Roebuck catalog in the mid to late 80s or early 90s. The material is a shimmering, water-resistant polyester-cotton blend with a matching silken inner lining, likely made of nylon. Features include a plain design with hidden buttons on the front, a small to medium sized plain collar with a special button showing at the collar, decorative epaulets with buttons on the shoulders, a distinctive single button midway on the back of the collar, sewn-in pockets near the lower hem with button flaps concealing both pockets, button straps near the cuff of the sleeves, and two inside pockets, one on each side. A tag located on the inside near the button-side hem may have a name on it. The back tag may or may not be sewn on a diamond shaped patch. Belongs to Ruth V Nash of Athens, GA.

Last seen on March 10th or earlier, possibly being worn by a homeless man at a Circle K station across from the Dairy Queen on West May Street in Winder. Was reported to have come from Jackson County and back North, possibly back there again. The jacket holds significant sentimental value to my grandmother. Please contact me at 7063530272 or 7066147078 if found or seen. I do not drive, so if you find it, I'll compensate you for mailing or shipping costs to return it.

$300 reward.

Please share 

PS (just in case) if you have or had any family in Winder Center for Nursing and Healing or discharged from there within the time I specified, please search their belongings to see if they didn't mix it up with theirs. It's quite clear the facility isn't going to cooperate with me.

This picture below is an approximation. Minus the belt and the hood. She got rid of those. Serves as an all weather jacket. Almost like a bluish purple. Will shine if put in direct light. She calls it ""postman style"" because it has two inside breast pockets, one on each side. Also two sewn in pockets on the waist with a button flap concealing them. Cuff straps. Shoulder straps with buttons on the shoulder side. Hidden buttons underneath a flap on the right side. Buttons should be a darker shade of the jacket's color. Inner lining is about the same color. If you need more help with the color, consult the last picture I have of her in it."

County Commission race outcomes: Perceptions of vote margins,17,1cz16wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1cz16wg/county_commission_race_outcomes_perceptions_of/,24,2024-05-23 15:21:14,"The County Commissioner races are over. There were some upsets all around. The toss-up race in D6 ended up actually being a major victory for Stephanie Johnson (but see below). In D2, Jason Jacobs barely broke 30% of the total votes. In D8, Mama Sid did not even break 30% of the vote count (I, therefore, do not need to go to Mama Sid’s for a pizza review).  

A major lesson I learned from these races is that I do not have a good sense of these districts. That’s fine. From the comments I received throughout the few months and how these races actually turned out, it appears most others do not either (except for D8, where the outcome seemed more obvious). Admittedly, I was a little more bullish on Jacobs given the striking number of D2 residents whom I know, who seemed (1) open to Jacobs and (2) cold on Link. The likely outcome was that these folks either did not turn out to vote at all or decided to just not vote for this particular race.

One lesson that everyone, including us Reddit nerds and also future local campaigns, can learn is about relations between vote margins and total number of registered voters. Below, I outline some estimates I derived from here: [https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/Clarke/121216/web.317647/#/summary?v=337907%2F](https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/Clarke/121216/web.317647/#/summary?v=337907%2F).

**District 2**

In District 2, Melissa Link beat Jason Jacobs, 68% to 32% (36% margin). The vote margin was 594 votes. There are 17,646 registered voters in District 2 and \~9% voted. The vote margin represents \~3% of the registered voters in District 2. A 1% increase in registered voters *actually voting* is 176 votes. 

**District 6**

In District 6, Stephanie Johnson beat Rashe Macolm, 58% to 42% (16% margin). The vote margin was 314 votes. There are 14,088 registered voters in District 6 and \~14% voted. The vote margin represents \~2% of the registered voters in District 6. A 1% increase in registered voters *actually voting* is 141 votes. 

**District 8**

In District 8, Carol Myers beat Sidney Waters, 72% to 28% (44% margin). The vote margin was 584 votes. There are 15,007 registered voters in District 8 and \~9% voted. The vote margin represents \~4% of the registered voters in District 8. A 1% increase in registered voters *actually voting* is 150 votes. 

**Relations between vote margins and total number of registered voters**

At first glance, vote margins of 36%, 16%, and 44%, indicate races not considered to be close. Leading up to the election, I certainly felt that the District 6 race was going to be close but Johnson won by 16%. I think that we need to make sure we understand the *perception* of vote margins. Yes, 16% is a high number, but it only reflected a vote margin 314 votes. That race seems a lot closer when you that District 6 has over 14,000 registered voters.  

In previous Reddit conversations, there appears to be a consensus about voter apathy. While voter accessibility in Athens-Clarke County appears to be high (thank you to all in our community who work the elections!) only \~10% of residents in the various districts turn out to vote. As we all know, this is not just a local problem, but it is, in fact, where local solutions can be most efficacious. 

I respect anyone putting their name on the ballot and, despite their past, I really do hope that the new member (D6) of the commission can work to make our community better. If not, my hope is that we hold them accountable in their next election.  "

Saturday is pretty much open until the wedding in the evening. They'll probably want to do breakfast at the hotel, but lunch could be an open play.

Also, if we're staying at the Hilton downtown, is the parking garage across the street the best option? Or do you guys have a local parking app for street parking that is superior?"

1. Crepes?

2. It's always packed with Greeks.

School's out so I said WTF and went there for lunch the other day.

I had the crepe equivalent of a Philly cheese steak and let me tell you it was delicious.  Lawlmartz doesn't know what she is missing.

Also had the black bean hummus appetizer, again delicious, and the bananas foster crepe for desert.  D. Lish. Ush.

Great service, full bar.

I thought that back in \~2010 when I was in school, trails connected the North Oconee Greenway up through the Nature Center and then north along sandy creek all the way to Sandy Creek Park including long sections of boardwalk along Sandy Creek.  

Now it looks like there is not one continuous trail system, and instead there is a large break between the Nature Center and the Cook's trail part of the Park.  

Am I misremembering that it was continuous back around 2010 or is part of the trail just not officially marked?"

We have several categories for now, and will probably add more later: 

Jerker of the day - given to someone who exhibits the qualities of a real Athens jerker

Grump of the day - for when you’re being a real sour puss

We’re sending someone RIGHT now. We WILL give you a ticket.” Like, for real? If I were trying to scam you out of parking, I wouldn’t have called. I’m not trying to park for free until the end of time. And BTW, I only parked there because there were no other spaces. Also, my damn meter doesn’t have a series of letters written on it in sharpie, no matter how many times you tell me it does. I’m LOOKING at it. Is it supposed to have letters? IDK. It has a number. That’s it. Sorry. 

Also related to parking: I’m seeing a bajillion tickets on windshields at UGA today. It’s the summer, but parking patrol is evidently still out in force."

He knows a few scales and can read tabs, but the rest is self taught via YouTube. We need someone to help him fill in the gaps and he works best in a mentor/mentee type relationship. His former instructor met with him for an hour every two weeks and send him off with things to work on between lessons. He’s drawn to bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Lamb of God, Trivium, etc. Any suggestions?

Beautiful location, they did a great job making it look like it has always been here, but I miss the haphazard coziness of Half Shep (which I always thought was too much for Athens). 

I understand I sound grumpy. But we live in a college town and I miss the seedy grossness of a sausage dog on the corner. Or cheap, filling gyro. Dollar pizza. Just because students are taking more loans or something to afford the 5k rents and nice cars doesn't mean we should continue to only cater to the wealthy. 

In college, I survived on 600 a month and that included rent. First full time job in Athens was 24k a year (the interview admitted they paid crap and asked if I had a roommate). My rent was cheap (Milford townhome before the big crash and our landlord stole the copper wiring out of the house one night) and food was not an issue. I could do it because we lived in a college town. 

Average income in Athens is 26k. Poverty level 20%. Schools are struggling. This model is unsustainable.

It all started back in May 2021 when A EBE member known as rap artist EBE Montana was killed on the highway. According to ACC Police and the DA, Montana was a member of RTG before switching to EBE and that’s how the conflict started. However the feud came back to the spotlight recently this year when a 3 year old child was killed by a stray bullet. Is there any other information anyone has on this? What are areas to generally avoid in Athens? And where are the areas where gang bangers usually hang out besides the public housing areas. "

I tried to make a new mom friend in Oconee County. This is what happened.,133,1ctcwyw,https://i.redd.it/ugwjdntxis0d1.jpeg,63,2024-05-16 09:28:43,"
Here's a very long and convoluted story about what happened when I moved out of Athens and tried to make friends in a new county. It's really long.

*

When you're a mom, it seems like you'd have a lot in common with other moms. You're both exhausted. You both can change a diaper while eating a hamburger while making a doctor's appointment while driving a car. She has spit-up on her shoulder? Yeah, well you have Goldfish in your hair.

 But it's surprisingly hard to make mom friends. Go to any park or playground, and you'll see lots of Lone Moms dotting the landscape, swiping at their smartphones while their children play. I don't know why this is, but it's always kind of bothered me.

 Raising children can be a terribly isolating endeavor. You are busy, but also bored, since most of the tasks required of you are mundane, repetitive ones like loading the dishwasher, cooking food, and extinguishing the dog. You are surrounded by people all day, but these people are mostly pre-verbal, so you end up feeling lonely a lot of the time. I would think that moms would flock to each other like toddlers flock to the one thing in the house their parents forgot to baby-proof. But no. It turns out that most moms don't mix.

 When I lived in Athens, GA, it wasn't so hard. I'd figured it out. I'd spy a mom fiddling with her Maya baby wrap next to the sensory play area, sidle up to her, and hit her with my opening conversational gambit: ""What's your position on ancient grains?"" And thus would begin a heartfelt conversation about Quinoa and Amaranth and what cereals they prefer. But I didn't really care what we were talking about. I just cared that we were talking.

 So I was anxious when I moved out of Athens to the tiny town of High Shoals. It's just over the border from Oconee County, and most moms in Oconee County don't talk about ancient grains. They talk about things I don't have any experience with and thus can't comment on, like who is their favorite area aesthetician. (The last time I had anything resembling a facial was when I fell asleep in the middle of feeding the dogs and woke up with one of them licking my face).

 Oconee moms talk about where they're spending their family's spring break (""not Destin""), and how Grayson was just robbed at the regional gymnastics finals. Oconee County is very affluent, and very conservative. You still can't get a beer there on Sundays, but at least the Zaxby's drive-through stays open til 10 pm.

 Nonetheless, I resolved to try to make new mom friends. I practiced smiling in the mirror and repeating ""What's your home church?"" (my new conversation starter) until there was only a hint of crazy-eye brought on by sleep deprivation. I worked on not making sweeping generalizations about people based on what county they live in. I reminded myself to brush my teeth and my hair every morning, instead of on alternating days like I usually do. Finally, shortly after Christmas, I was ready to go.

 Now, at the same time all of this introspection about friend-making was going on, my oldest girl asked me for a puppy. I told her no and she went away. Then two days later she came back with a compromise: ""How about a rat?""

 Probably most folks consider ""provide a rat-free environment for your children to live in"" to be up there with other parenting dictates like ""don't feed your baby Jagermeister."" These are rules that are so obvious that they don't even bear mentioning. But when Sadie asked for a rat, I thought back to what happened when my teenaged self and friends watched the punk-rock adolescent classic ""Suburbia."" 

Inspired by a character who had a tame rat as a pet, several of my friends rushed out and secured rats for themselves. They would carry them around in the pockets of their leather jackets when they went to the mall to ask an adult to buy clove cigarettes for them. These rats, I remembered, were well-mannered, good-natured varmints.

 A quick look on the web confirmed my memories. Rats, the internet assured me, are smart, and social. They are friendly, and loyal, and can be trained to learn their names and do tricks. If you aren't squicked out by the naked, scaly tail, the bulging genitalia, the beady eyes and twitching whiskers, and the general association of rats with things like plague and death, a rat might be just the thing for you.

 My husband was not enthusiastic about this plan, mainly because one of his morning rituals is going out to check the trap in our chicken coop to see what predator was snared overnight. Sometimes he'll come in in the morning with a possum in the trap, or even a black snake. But usually, it's a rat. 

""Robin,"" he said, trying to sound reasonable, ""Please don't go out and voluntarily purchase more vermin. We have plenty of rats right here."" He pointed at the hissing, red-eyed rodent trying to gnaw its way out of the cage he'd just carried in from the coop.

 ""Yeah, but those rats are different,"" I said, hoping he wouldn't ask me why.

 ""Why?"" he said. ""It's exactly the same thing. It's a rat.""

 ""Well..."" I said, trying to stall. ""Not really. See, this is an outdoor rat. We're getting an indoor one. Plus, these rats are free. The rat I'm going to get costs $18.""

    My husband loves me, and he loves Sadie. But mainly, he's tired. And so eventually Sadie got her rat. Honey lived happily in Sadie's room in his 3-tiered Rat Palace, and every day I would take time out from soothing the infant and wrestling with the 3-year-old to play with the rat, something the pet store warned I had to do if I wanted to socialize him.

 ""Time to coddle the rat,"" I'd announce to the children, disappearing up the stairs to Sadie's room. I'd take Honey out of his cage and scratch his neck and ears. I'd hold him in my palm and encourage him to climb up my arm to my shoulder. I'd turn on Sadie's radio and the two of us would listen to Katy Perry together.

 Eventually, as Honey grew, I started taking him downstairs on brief field trips. I'd put him in the sleeve of my sweater, down by my wrist. If I kept my arm bent he would rest there contentedly, and eventually I would become embroiled in making baby food or putting away toys and would completely forget that I had a rather large rat in my sleeve.

 One afternoon in January, Sadie suggested that we visit a park in Oconee County. We got ourselves ready and, as we were heading out the door, Sadie stopped and said, ""Hey, why don't we bring Honey?"" I agreed and so Sadie cleaned out one of her purses and stuffed Honey inside. 

When we got to the park, I decided it would not be safe for Sadie to run around on the playground with a bag full of rat (I do have some standards), so I offered to put Honey in my sleeve. She handed over the rat, which settled in the sleeve of my v-neck sweater, and ran off to play.

 At first, we were alone on the playground. But after a while a mini-van pulled into the parking lot and a mom and her daughter climbed out. The daughter was the same age as Sadie, and they began enthusiastically playing together as soon as the girl hit the playground. I stood on the other side of the jungle gym from the other mom, wishing I had some of my daughter's friend-making mojo.

 Then I remembered my resolution. ""This could be it,"" I realized, watching the other mom through the slats in the climbing structure. ""This could be my new mom friend."" 

I remembered that if I wanted to enlarge my social circle and meet people in this new town, I'd have to invest some energy and take some risks. I remembered what I had told myself about being friendly and open and willing to meet someone where they are. I remembered all of those things. Sadly, I forgot that I had a rat in my sleeve.

 I circled around the jungle gym closer to the other mom, trying to make it look like I was moving just to get a better view of my kid. When I was close enough to her to not have to yell, I gave her a big, friendly smile, and said ""Our kids seem to enjoy playing together.""

 ""They sure do!"" said the other mom, brightly. She smiled, too, and the conversation with my first Oconee County mom was launched.

 ""How old is she? Oh, mine too! What school does she go to? Does she like it? Yes, we do live close by. We just moved. You grew up here? Seems like a nice place.""

 Outside, I was engaging in normal-sounding small talk. But inside, I was rejoicing. ""I'm doing it!"" I thought. ""I'm having a normal conversation with another adult! I'm not crying, or babbling, or forgetting where in the sentence I am! I'm just a few more comments away from suggesting our kids meet up at the library some time, and when I do that, she'll say sure, and she'll have to come to the library, too, since her kid is only six and can't drive, and then we'll see each other again and then Bam! Mom friends! Yahoo!""

 I decided to close the deal. I said, as casually as possible, ""It's great that our kids are having so much fun together. Do you guys ever do any of the afternoon art things at the library?""

 The other mom smiled and said, ""Yes, we...do. We do go there sometimes.""

 ""Great!"" I said.

 But things were not great. 

Something had happened in between my question about the library and her response. I didn't know what it was, exactly, but I could sense it. The other mom was still smiling, still making eye-contact with me. But something had changed. 

I replayed the conversation in my head. The slight pause in her answer to my question about the library. ""Yes, we...do."" Her eyes had flicked away from my face and down to my chest for a split second -- just a momentary glance -- before meeting mine again. I'd seen her do it but had thought nothing of it, because she'd looked back at me and finished answering. 

And she was still looking at me, her face absolutely calm and straight and normal. Nothing bad was happening. She was still standing there, probably waiting for me to suggest a meeting. So what was the problem?

 As surreptitiously as possible (which was not at all, since she was standing 2 feet away from me, watching my face) I dropped my own eyes down to my chest. And then I understood. 

Honey, the rat who was so at home in my sweater sleeve that I often forgot he was there, had crawled up my sleeve and around to the front, and was now poking his head out of the point in the ""v"" of my v-neck sweater.

 Looking at it from my perspective, I'm just a mom who is trying to make a new friend and who also happens to have a rat crawling around in her sweater. What's the big deal? But from her perspective? 

I can hear her standing in her kitchen, staring into a big glass of red wine and telling it to her husband. ""A woman tried to talk to me at the park today, but there was a rat in her sweater, so...""

 I looked up from the trembling pink nose and sharp eyes of the rodent poking out of my cleavage and into the face of the woman I was never, ever going to be friends with. I had absolutely no idea what etiquette was called for in this situation. Should I acknowledge what was happening with a breezy ""oh, ha, don't worry, he's tame""?

 Or should I feign surprise, and act as shocked as she?  ""Oh my gosh,"" I could shriek, batting at my sweater, ""How did that get in there?"" Was it worse to be the kind of person who puts vermin in her sweater on purpose? Or the kind who gets fully dressed without realizing there's a rat loose in her clothing? I couldn't decide.

 Because this is the South -- the place where one's darkest character failings are met with a sweet ""bless your heart!"" -- the other mom didn't do what some other moms might have done (e.g., pepper spray me while calling Child Protective Services). Instead, she decided to do the polite thing, and pretend that our casual conversation hadn't just been interrupted by the appearance of a clothing rodent. 

She stood there, her serene expression belying the tsunami of WTF? probably roiling in her head, and exchanged a few more banal pleasantries with me. Taking my cue from her, I also tried to ignore the rat, who had crawled down to the waist of my sweater and now nestled there like a distended appendix.

 ""Well,"" I said finally, ""I guess we'd better get on home."" All the other things I wanted to say -- ""Maybe we'll see each other again!"" ""It was great talking to you!"" -- felt like chalk in my mouth as I walked with my daughter to the mini-van.

 ""That girl was really nice!"" said Sadie, climbing in her booster seat. ""Maybe we could meet her here again.""

 ""Maybe so,"" I said, reaching under my sweater and extracting Honey. He thrashed and twisted as I inserted him into the purse Sadie had brought along.

 ""We could play with Honey, maybe,"" Sadie said as I started the van. ""Do you think she likes rats too?""

   ""I don't know, Bean,"" I sighed. Should I tell her that, no, she probably doesn't like rats very much at all. Should I tell her that if she wants to be accepted in her new town, she needs to lose the rat and turn her face to more normal little-girl pursuits, like weaving bracelets out those damn rubber band circles? Should I tell her that the weird things she loves are the very same things that will make her lonely? The way her mom sometimes is?

 ""I don't know,"" I said again. ""But I'll tell you what. If you find a person who likes both you and your rat, you snag 'em, OK? That's when you know you've found a friend."" I pulled the car out of the lot and drove myself, my daughter, and our pet rat back home."

Hello everyone, first off this is a serious post about my proposal to for a new transportation system

  
Now, in my ideal world there would be only bike paths everywhere. However, I concede that not everyone is always able to use a bike for transportation in this day and age. While considering this problem I came up with an amazing idea: the Athens Monorail!.

There is nothing on earth like a genuine bonafide electrified six car monorail. I'll describe to you all the ways my monorail can help improve the economy and overall change the way of life for the citizens of Athens.

  
**The Stations:**

The monorail stations are placed in the most strategic positions to form what will henceforth be know as: **The Triangle of Trust**. The triangle, being the strongest of all shapes cannot be broken. 

Each station will have a unique purpose and theme. I'll start with the first station: 

The Chicago Union Station. Named with the intent to confuse unaware passengers (do we really want people coming to our city who can't read a map?). This station will be in the place of the Home Deport on Epps Bridge because there is a Lowes like right across the street and I don't think we really need two hardware stores that close. This station will feature an EXPANSIVE parking deck so that all east bound traffic from Atlanta can park their cars and enter the station. Upon exiting the parking garage and entering the station, passengers will be greeted with a huge atrium complete with exotic dancers and holographic displays directing them to their platforms.

Eastside Station will take over everyone's favorite abandoned shopping center. This will be the most modest of all the stations and will be themed to resemble a log cabin and maybe have an aquarium, I don't know. There will be very few lights and it will be a place you should be scared to be at night time.

Downtown Station will exist completely underground with only a small entrance above ground. This will of course service all of downtown, but will also include numerous restaurants, shops, and a funeral home. To get from the platform to the surface we will feature high-speed escalators powered by the flow of the river.

  
**The Train**:

The train cars will all be designed and powered by an eternal engine so that in the event of a city-wide emergency they can be used snowpiercer style as a safe place for people to live. As mentioned before, all the trains will be six cars, however the first two cars will be exclusive ""luxury"" cars and can be rented out for orgies or whatever rich people do. Each train will of course run on ONE RAIL, however there will be two sets of rail so that trains can be going in both directions. People crossing to the inside track will need to jump over the outside one when a train isn't coming.



**Funding:**

If every citizen in Athens signs up for as many credit cards as they can, then we can max them out to fund the monorail. Also, we can borrow as much as we can and sell any assets we have.  The future generation will appreciate us for doing this for them. Eminent domain will apply to all property in the way of the completion of the monorail, no expense will be spared to demolish historical or cultural buildings in the way. It will run both above and below ground in a perfectly straight line to allow maximum speed. 

  
Well, I hope everyone likes my idea. I'll see about getting it on a ballot, I'm sure it will be approved. Remember, when things look glum, vote for the one. The one being the one rail AKA monorail."

This is interesting because Fisher is considered to be a center-left politician on the commission. These labels mean nothing, BTW.  

Spicy take: Fisher is planning to run for mayor and is trying to consolidate ‘non-hyper-left’ and ‘middle-of-the-road’ voters. It appears he’s already got Stephanie Johnson’s constituency and organizers (and more???). 

It’s a smart bet. Why not, right? I’m sure that Fisher and Link do not agree on a lot of issues, and it is an easy endorsement to throw under the rug if Link wins…D2 is the most progressive district in town, anyways.  

At the end of the day, Fisher showed his cards. Spicy take? "

I got the 65 small plate and it was very very good. personally i think the 65 wrap is better than the plate, but you cant go wrong either way! i told him how passionate i am about good food and he let me try a few other things they had! the panner marsala was really really good, as well as everything else! you can taste the love that goes into the food. so much flavor in every bite. i was a little apprehensive of the price bc i am a broke college student, but it was well worth it especially with the naan

The kurma tasted pretty good, but it was not what i was expecting. tasted pretty much like broc chedder soup with a ton of bay leaf and cardamon. the goat curry would have been better if it wasn't ice cold, but still lacked flavor. They gave my gf chicken 65 (that we didn't order) with her butter chicken and it also just didn't hit the spot. Was really looking forward to them opening up, and will go back in a month and see if they have fixed the kinks, but waiting 45 minutes and spending $15 for 5 chunks of cold chicken makes me not want to go back. will try curry love next! have high hopes based on their 65 wrap!"

Boomers have no right to complain about property taxes.,13,1co0zzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1co0zzk/boomers_have_no_right_to_complain_about_property/,118,2024-05-09 12:10:58,"You heard me. Now that property taxes have been sent out all I see are Boomers screaming over how much they cost and how they play the system so that they can get their taxes lowered. 

**Keep in mind these are people who:** 

* Voted in favor of increases to programs like SPLOST (sales tax increases for local schools on a county by county basis) while their kids were in school.
* Repeatedly voted to get tax breaks while they were still earning income. (Example, I personally know of many who took advantage of the 'electric vehicle' tax credit so they could buy golf carts darn near for free because they are technically 'street legal'.)
* Used tax breaks to increase the size/overall value of their homes and missed the boat on selling 3 years ago.
* Claim they want more businesses & jobs within county limits, and then scream and cry over the fact that in order to get businesses to build in an area, you have to offer the businesses tax breaks (usually by saying that they don't have to pay property taxes for their facility for 30 some-odd years) in order to entice them to build, and then become shocked when the difference gets spread among taxpayers. 
* Already have access to filing a homestead exemption in place to lower their property taxes, which I believe also increases at age 65.
* Didn't seem to have a problem with it when *their* kids were going to public schools, but now that their kids have graduated, the public school system isn't their problem anymore and don't feel as though they should have to pay.

**If you live in an area, you pay property taxes to fund the school system.** ***End of*****.** If you think your taxes are too high, *you can downsize and move*. But what you DON'T get to do *is create the problem* and then whine and complain because you didn't plan your retirement appropriately."

I'll be living in Athens from May to December in order to study at UGA, and this will be my first time in US. I'll be around Riverband for two months until I find another place. Since I'm not from US, I'll be using bus a lot, where do you recommend doing grocery shopping near there? How much is bus and I can pay only with money, how is it work?

I know that it may sound dumb, but it is because I don't know how things really work outside my country, I'm very excited  for the trip, everything will be new to me :D

Thank you!"

Welp. Just ate at the New Mexican restaurant San Angel Cocina and Cantina.,62,1cmilk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1cmilk8/welp_just_ate_at_the_new_mexican_restaurant_san/,75,2024-05-07 14:16:24,"I figured I would give a little mini review for those interested in that sort of thing.

The water was disgusting. It tasted like drinking from a garden hose. I brought this up and hopefully they get a legitimate filter installed. 1/10

The chips were a bit dark, but fresh. Pretty thick, great for dipping. They didn’t try to do anything different here, same chips as Sr. Sol. 6/10

The table salsa actually had small chunks of onion and cilantro in it, the consistency was decent but it tasted as bland as la parilla’s tomato puree poor excuse for table salsa. It’s serviceable but nothing special. 5/10

The cheese dip was exactly the same flavor and consistency of Agua Linda’s/La parilla’s cheese dip, which to me is less than stellar but cheese dip is cheese dip. I was particularly sad about this because I love the variety different restaurants offer but there is nothing new here. 5/10

The street tacos were really good, their corn tortillas are allegedly made in house, and they were really good. I had a chicken and steak taco. The chicken was higher quality than La Parilla, and tasted like chicken. The steak however was better tasting than any other steak I’ve had in town. The tacos are also served with ‘dressing’, I had the Avocado and Chipotle options, both were very good. 8/10

The decor and vibe was very Miami night club, which is fine. Odd for lunch on a Tuesday but appropriate for a weekend dining experience. 8/10

Overall based on my first experience I’ll probably return. I still need to try their guacamole, rice and beans, as well as their other meats. 

They did have a limited menu which doesn’t bother me, but the owner/manager was bragging about the full menu having over 40 items on it which can be detrimental, so I am cautious about that.

I think that about covers it.

This program is free and open to the public, including free parking offered to visitors in the Hull Street Deck.

[**Tuesday, June 4th @ 5:15 PM - Film Screening: Love Free or Die**](https://www.libs.uga.edu/events/film-screening-love-free-or-die)

On Tuesday, June 4th at 5:15PM, join the Walter J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection for a screening of ""Love Free or Die"" at Cine Athens. Following the screening, Bishop Gene and Director Macky Alston will discuss the film and answer questions from the audience. This event is free and open to the public; however, tickets are required upon entry. You can reserve tickets ahead of time online through Cine Athens.

“Love Free or Die” is about a man whose two defining passions are in direct conflict: his love for God and for his partner Mark. Gene Robinson is the first openly gay person to become a bishop in the historic traditions of Christendom. His consecration in 2003, to which he wore a bullet-proof vest, caused an international stir. 

The film follows Robinson from small-town churches in the New Hampshire North Country to Washington’s Lincoln Memorial to London’s Lambeth Palace, as he calls for all to stand for equality – inspiring bishops, priests and ordinary folk to come out from the shadows and change history. 

[**Tuesday, June 11th @ 3 PM - Film Screening: The Power to Heal**](https://www.libs.uga.edu/events/film-screening-power-heal)

POWER TO HEAL is an hour-long public television documentary that tells a poignant chapter in the historic struggle to secure equal and adequate access to healthcare for all Americans. Central to the story is the tale of how a new national program, Medicare, was used to mount a dramatic, coordinated effort that desegregated thousands of hospitals across the country in a matter of months. 

[**Friday, August 30th @ 5:30 PM - Film Screening: Saving the Chattahoochee**](https://www.libs.uga.edu/events/film-screening-saving-chattahoochee)

Gym in Hull,15,1ck85xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1ck85xx/gym_in_hull/,9,2024-05-04 15:20:25,"Those of you who have mentioned wanting a gym near space Kroger, there's now one 5 minutes up the road past the Ingles that opened today.

It's small but adequate. I think the question is going to be how crowded is it when busy? It seems it could feel claustrophobic if crowded since it's a fairly small space. The owner, Josh Chronic, is a cool guy just trying to fill a need in Hull. Worth it to give it a look. "

It opened last night and it was so cool. There’s a Nintendo in the lobby you can play, and the show itself is about a dad and a kid playing a video game. 

The game sequences are unlike anything I’ve ever seen on a community theater stage. There’s animation of the game itself, plus a modern dancer who represents the hero in the game. And it’s all set to 90s-esque electronic music written specifically for the show. 

Tickets are just $5, and the show is only 90 minutes. Definitely worth it.

School Vouchers and what it means for CCSD,15,1cc0kpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1cc0kpj/school_vouchers_and_what_it_means_for_ccsd/,20,2024-04-24 11:07:09,"Governor Kemp signed the school voucher bill into law yesterday. I did some digging about what it might imply for Clarke County Schools. Here are the main features that I gather from reading the bill.

* $6500 per year for expenses to the private school of your choice. There are some basic reporting requirements for choice schools, but the criteria for qualifying seems fuzzy.
* To initially qualify, you need the following:
   * Household income needs to be less than 4x the federal poverty level, which is $100K for a family of 3 and $120K for a family of 4.
   * You must live in the attendance zone of a low-performing school. From what I found, the following schools in CCSD qualify:
      * Alps Road Elementary
      * Gaines Elementary
      * Whit Davis Road Elementary
      * Coile Middle

This represents 16% of the 13K students in the district.

* Your child must either be entering kindergarten or attended one of the low-performing schools in the past year.
* As far as I can tell, if your child was in the program in the prior year, then you qualify as long as you meet the income requirement.

Some thoughts:

* The criteria for low-performing schools is currently based only on test scores. This is more reflective of socio-economic status of the student population than anything the schools do. The state does compute some slightly more informative metrics like test score growth but from what I gather it currently does not use them.
* The low-performing school metric is also zero-sum since 25 percent of schools in the state will always be low performing, no matter how well schools perform overall.
* By my read, the way qualification is computed penalizes low-performing elementary schools more than other schools since the main entry point into the program is kindergarten. After that, a child can qualify through grade 12. In other words, if you are in the attendance zone Watkinsville Elementary (not on list) and Coile Middle (on list) the only way you can get in is by attending Coile for one year. In the end, This could give districts incentives to focus on test scores in elementary schools to get them off the list. (NB I find the wording of the law very confusing on this so would welcome corrections if I don't have the facts straight.)
* There could also be some gaming by families. You could, for example, rent a house in the Alps Road attendance zone when your child is entering kindergarten and then move anywhere else in Georgia after that and still get the voucher through Grade 12.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out. I suspect the current structure was thrown together to get the last few votes in the House, with the expectation of changing or expanding it in the future."

Creature Comforts Overcharging?,33,1cbwqen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1cbwqen/creature_comforts_overcharging/,69,2024-04-24 08:20:06,"One of my favorite things about some bars/breweries in town (like Creature Comforts) is when they swipe your card and start a tab along with your first order. I like this because it means when I'm ready to leave I don't have to go stand in line and bother a bartender just to close out. The establishment then closes your tab at the end of the night and throws on 20% gratuity.

However, I noticed that the last couple visits to Creature produced charges that were $10-15 more than I expected. I chalked it up to being in groups and someone getting a beer on my tab, no biggie. But it did start making me keep a closer eye on it during my visit this past Saturday. My partner and I each had a standard draft beer and then decided to bounce to another spot. The charge hit the card the next day at $33, which seems a bit much for 2 beers and 20% grat.

~~I've considered two possibilities: (1) beers are mistakenly put on my tab b/c of my last name but my surname is  rare (only other people I've known with it are family members) or (2) Creature charges a fee AND 20% to close out a tab, but wouldn't they have to notify customers?~~  Beers were mistakenly added to tab.

So I'm just left kinda confused why this appears to keep happening. I thought I'd post about it because I'm fairly confident it's happened multiple times now, and to see if anyone else has had this experience at Creature.

I know ultimately this is on me because my preference to not close out my tab and leave it for the business to handle. Out of curiosity, how do those in the serving industry feel about this? Is it better just to close out?

  
Update: Called in and asked about it. They said the tab showed 4 beers, apologized and immediately took off the two beers. Went above and beyond to make it right. "

"Fractal Artichoke's fireside chats presents, ""US House District 10 Race: The unfolding natural experiment"" ",17,1cb7wsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1cb7wsb/fractal_artichokes_fireside_chats_presents_us/,24,2024-04-23 11:46:18,"Last week, I posted a ‘Vibe Check’ about the US House District 10’s Democratic Primary. My ‘Vibe Check’ does not reflect who I want to win. It is influenced by an aggregate of data streams, from one-on-one discussions I’ve had with people in the community to viewing townhalls and interviews (thanks u/AthensPoliticsNerd and AthCast host u/mattpulver93), and also a growing appreciation of the political dynamics that occurred in Athens for the past few decades. It’s an honest opinion at a certain point in time. 

One issue that came up a few times in the interesting discussions on that thread was whether or not it matters at all who wins the D10 Democratic Primary. Afterall, as some have said, D10 is a lost cause for a democrat. I disagree. Although I am not certain 2024 is the cycle that a democrat wins D10, I’m convinced that a strong democratic candidate will be impactful for other races. I’m also excited because **we have a natural experiment unfolding before our weary, sometimes cynical, eyes**.  

In a very simple experimental design, a scientist wants to have a control group and an experimental group. The idea is that if, all things being equal except for the changing parameter that occurs in the experimental group, you observe a change in a dependent variable (e.g., the number of votes a candidate in D10 receives in 2024), we can attribute that change to properties that make up the changing parameter. Although not perfect because the Social Sciences are inherently complex, I would argue that the 2022 US House District 10 race is a good control group and the 2024 US House District 10 race is a good experimental group. **What is the main parameter that has changed across the control and experimental group? Effort and strategy**. In 2022, the democratic candidate in D10 pretty much ghosted the general election. No effort. No strategy. Everyone I have talked to about the 2022 race (and earlier ones) felt this way, too.  

In 2024, we have an interesting natural experiment unfolding before our eyes in D10. Let’s look at last cycle’s D10 outcome. In 2022, Collins beat TJG by 29% (198,523 votes to 109,107 votes), which is a vote margin of 89,416 votes. This is the control condition. \~29% is the vote margin when there is really no effort or strategy produced by a democratic candidate. In 2024, Collins is the republication candidate again. Many things have changed since 2022, too. But, whomever the democratic nominee is for D10, I put my money on them putting in the effort and following through with a real campaign strategy. If this is the case, **how much does effort and strategy reduce the vote margin**? Does it reduce the vote margin by 5%? By 10%? Let’s look at some numbers. Key assumption: These numbers are based directly from the 2022 results, so do not reflect any anticipated differences in voter turnout. 

If the vote margin is reduced by \~5%, so if Collins beats whomever in 2024 by 24% (190,832 votes to 116,797 votes), the vote margin is 74,034 (62%-38%). **Compared to 2022, that’s a difference of over 15,000 votes**. If the vote margin is reduced by \~10%, so if Collins beats whomever in 2024 by 19% (183,141 votes to 124,488 votes), the vote margin is 58,653 (60%-40%). **Compared to 2022, that’s a difference of over 30,000 votes.** 

Is a change in 15,000 votes impactful at all? What about a change in 30,000 votes? We have a pretty good benchmark here in Georgia that was made famous in 2020 by DJT, on a recording, telling Secretary of State Raffensperger, “I just want to find 11,780 votes”.  Why 11,780 votes? Because Biden won the state of Georgia by 11,779 votes. So, I ask again, what does effort and strategy get the democratic candidate in D10 in 2024? Is it 5% more of the votes (change in 15,000+ votes)? Is it 10% more of the votes (change in 30,000+)? 

Perhaps the cynics among us are correct that effort and strategy gets them nothing. I, for one, am excited to see how this natural experiment plays out. Stay optimistic out there, ya’ll. Spicy takes? "

"I finally did it! While it was pretty cool, I DID walk away wondering…",11,1c7wehu,https://www.instagram.com/flatsatgeneraltime?igsh=dmRkaHNjNGtxcDB1,6,2024-04-19 09:04:52,"Go out to Wire Park that is; I have been aware of this development, and following it for a while, so it was really cool to be able to check out the new Oconee Library, and see the overall layout/feel of the area as a whole. MY question, however, is about General Time (Westclox), which would be Athens’ equivalent, with some big, local twists.

As far as I know, this is the same type/category of project, despite being around half of Wire Park’s size, of the “industrial warehouse being brought back to life”, adaptive re-use community for Athens proper. But what IS going on out there on Newton Bridge? It seems like the project itself is quietly brewing in the background, with some of the apartments starting to advertise/lease and be available for move-in soon. I’ll see if I can link it in the comments, but I wonder why the commercial front has been so quiet; this project was announced before COVID, and the Wayfair office is already there. Does ANYONE know anything about what is to come office/restaurant/retail-wise? UNLIKE Oconee, Athens, as a town, is known for being a creative haven for artists, musicians, and “alternative” people of all types, and I would think that the way this project was pitched, it would be the “artsy, bohemian” counterpart to the mainstream, “suburban” mall (re)development. Think Ponce City Market, or West Midtown in general: lofts, a food hall, and a more “quirky, offbeat” feel that almost PERFECTLY matches “what” Athens is as a whole, as opposed to the (mostly) family crowd out in Watkinsville.

Also, again going back to not only HOW this was first llustrated/proposed, AND the fact that aside from Terrapin, this area seems about as far, physically and in terms of the current “vibe” of the area, “undergraduate, college kid” as you can get, so why would they come out the gate marketing to students? Obviously students CAN, and sometimes DO rent, anywhere, but EVERYTHING, like most of the other “mixed-use” sites around town, about this seems geared towards a young professional crowd, mainly creatives/hipsters, who can go to work at either their office downstairs, get a beer at Terrapin, and watch a folk/indie band play on Saturday night before going to a restaurant that feels like a grown-up, bougie cousin of World Famous with their partner/friends, all without leaving the area. 

With ALL of that being said, does anyone have any “intel” on the current phase of development, and when the commercial section(s) might start, and what we might see out there in terms of business/retail mix? I see it brought up in here occasionally, and it is on the concept maps that the city/county have poured a lot of time in over the past several months, but never a press release/interview from the developers themselves…

(P.S., While we talk about West Midtown and Ponce, are there any, planned or existing, properties that are ON the Firefly Trail/Greenway, with direct entrances from the path? I have seen this brought up a few times, but, with the powers that be opposing light rail in almost ANY format/route, all of these separate developments, and more that will likely come in the next few years, a “Beltline”-like dynamic/feel would do SO MUCH for families, townies, and students alike. People already bike/walk along the path in its current form, but imagine a scene where there is a “stream” of people of all ages (in both directions) throughout the day, and ESPECIALLY when it is sunny out, roller skating, jogging, and getting food/drinks at different spot, all without leaving the trail itself.)"

Interest in free telecom/telephony/VoIP orientation?,3,1c6cxyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1c6cxyw/interest_in_free_telecomtelephonyvoip_orientation/,4,2024-04-17 11:35:19,"Just throwing a spaghetto at the wall here. I've been a telecom platform software implementor and engineering consultant to the VoIP industry for the better part of two decades. Many professionals have their own ways of giving back to the community. During my decade in Atlanta, I would occasionally give free or nonprofit (i.e. cover cost of venue rental) seminars on telephony and VoIP.

The primary audience for this were IT people who had no voice communications background but found technical responsibility for VoIP systems falling into their lap, sometimes suddenly and without warning, as the industry changed. Historically, ""phone people"" and ""IT people"" are a largely nonoverlapping group, and don't really talk, and approach technology very differently. The sudden convergence of these worlds I think left IT people a little out of pocket, and the seminars were well-attended.

I'd typically cover some of these, tailored for the audience:

* Some history of the Bell system and Post/Telegraph/Telephone state monopolies elsewhere in the world;
* Some information and communication theory, i.e. the distinction between signalling and bearer channels;
* Signal multiplexing as a central challenge of telephone evolution, and its evolution from electromechanical to digital (i.e. Frequency Division Multiplexing to Time Division Multiplexing);
* Architecture of the traditional landline switching system (i.e. central offices, or telephone exchanges, and how they connect to each other through so-called ""tandems"", how LATAs work, etc);
* Large-scale multiplexing and digital cross connect systems;
* PBXs and business phone systems;
* Number portability and routing;
* SS7 (Signalling System 7) and ISDN;
* Unique challenges of supporting telephony, and in a general sense, real-time communication, on a packet-switched medium (i.e. the Internet);
* The role of SIP (my particular specialty) and industry consolidation around it as a signalling technology, and interoperability with SS7, ISDN and traditional telephony.

Some of this stuff is becoming a bit less relevant, as more and more traditional SS7 interconnections go to IP. However, I think the historical arc is important for context, and understanding what makes voice and video on the Internet special depends on some sense of how we got here, and how that path differs to the one taken by other things on the Internet, like the Web.

I also spend a little time on mobile networks and RF interfaces, but that's not my area, though I do talk about how mobile operators connect to everyone else.

Anyway, I don't know that there's enough of a specialised IT crowd in Athens to generate a lot of grassroots demand for this type of conversation. What I wonder is whether there would be any interest in a shorter version of this that would be tailored to a more general audience, and presented in less technical and more information-theoretical terms, or, alternately, through a more applied lens. Specifically, I get occasional questions from office administrators and other folks tangentially involved in VoIP, mostly about why their VoIP system sucks, or how to choose a good one, etc. I rarely have specific answers, but I haven't found met any other practitioners of this type of IP communications work, outside of one or two well-known large organisations.

Maybe it'd fill an education gap. It might not; I work on the ""back side"" of the industry, with service providers, not particularly close to telephony end-users. However, perhaps sharing some of this background would help some folks wrangling VoIP in local government, regional healthcare systems, nonprofits, etc.

Maybe? Or is it sort of like offering to give a seminar on a deeply esoteric topic in medical billing, estate law, intra-industrial sand and gravel sales, or some other abstruse area nobody cares about?"

Go up to Ingles knowing I'll be spending more on the snacks I wanted bc I was going to use the Kroger digital coupons but I'm stubborn and would rather have them now, only to hear on the intercom that the store is closed at 11. I asked the cashier ""Is there some weird regional grocery store closing thing happening right now?"" And was told they started closing at 11pm instead of midnight on March 11th because they just couldn't afford to be open that late anymore. 

I rarely shop at Ingles but it was very handy if/when I couldn't make it to Kroger or Walmart by 11 knowing there was at least one other place open for a little while even if a few extra miles away. Unless Oglethorpe CVS is still open until midnight there's officially no grocery store open past 11pm in Athens.

Sorry I’m just pissed, I didn’t know getting the most simple thing took so long.

Regardless, I’m out of $250-350 just by letting this guy take my car. I’m still new to Athens and I thought he was just going to come to my house as he’s a MOBILE mechanic, not a “mobile mechanic who gets your car towed to his shop to check it out”"

Even something as small as going to a local government meeting and voicing it would be awesome to me, as I just want to have my voice heard in some way, shape or form… And as a resident of this new city (new to me) I feel like it’s important to get involved if you believe something could better all the residents.

What would be a good starting point?

I’m thankful we even have the current infrastructure of public transportation although it is barely passable. Needless to say it’s still a good thing as we already have something in place, making improvements on it wouldn’t be too hard in the grand scheme of things.

I think the biggest problem with it and from what I’ve heard from other people is how infrequent the stops are along with how late they can be sometimes. My friend who’s a student at UGA told me her stop comes once an hour and it can come at erratic times… In the off chance she misses it, she has to wait another hour just to catch another one.

For my case, I live on east side and the closest stop to me is a 22 minute walk. I know compared to other cities I have no room to complain, but I live in a community on east side with hundreds of people and all the residents here think we need a bus stop as well.

Athens: What's the living costs like?,36,1c2dq9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1c2dq9i/athens_whats_the_living_costs_like/,75,2024-04-12 12:36:29,"Hello all, I was accepted to UGA for my PhD (from West Virginia, so still Southern but just a bit northern geographically), but I'm posting this to talk about Athens as a city. I was down there recently and it was quite nice, but I must factor in living costs. What is the average living cost (per month) for:

\-Renting an apartment (preferably close to the university)

\-Food expenses (I'm not the type of guy who tends to eat out a whole lot, and I tend to buy for a two-week period at a time)

\-Gas prices (I know they fluctuate, but a rough average)

\-Other things adjacent to living expenses (I'm not a heavy spender type of person but having a bit of spare ""rainy day money"" would always be a net plus).

So… what now? (Long post incoming…),84,1c1buyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1c1buyi/so_what_now_long_post_incoming/,82,2024-04-11 06:39:35,"As anyone who checks this forum (literally ever) knows, there is a large economic/urban development shift to come in Athens in the next few years. Being a UGA student from metro Atlanta, who is in a “mid 20s/young professional category”, I have been following urban development for a long time. With the projects either currently in their first phases of a long construction, or those that are scheduled for later this year, I want to pick you all’s thoughts.
  
(As a black man myself, it would be wrong for me to not open this up with the fact that this city with a black-population running back to, and literally building, the first buildings, structures, and economy of this city we reside in. ANY development should put the needs of this community, their homes/neighborhoods (such as Linnentown), and their voices that have been repeatedly stomped on and disrupted while also providing the foundation for Athens/Clarke/UGA/the surrounding counties.) 

1. How will all of the the new student housing, the North Downtown project, the Classic Center, the Varsity mixed-use, the new dorm, and the numerous several largerhotels change the character/feel of downtown? Right now Downtown is the official “college town” neighborhood, with hundreds of thousands of people on any given night, but the community’s (logical and in my opinion, well placed) focus on density and having downtown as a node mean that although the other districts, such as Five Points and Normaltown, and some new ones in the works will develop entertainment zones, the “downtown scene” that the students/townies/visitors change significantly? There is a “undergrad”/“townie” divide, with there being a “cross-pollination for both in some circumstances) but it seems that some of the yuppies that are not affiliated with either UGA or the music/hipster/arts culture that “defines” the other side of the khaki might cause there to be a birth of some new cocktail bars, “trendy spots”, or even a few “upscale” clubs.

2. How will the economic landscape of the town itself change? Right now, the university is the dominant employer, with healthcare and the government following behind. Unlike some of its more “there’s just the college and nothing else” focused siblings, there is a segment of the population that lives here unaffiliated with the school. When this medical school opens, Piedmont would either increase size further than the budding teaching hospital right now, or a “UGA Health/Hospital” system, likely still in Normaltown, would still need A BUNCH of ancillary people (physicians, nurses, rehab/physical therapists, business staff, JUST to scratch the surface) to function as a normal medical provider to the region. Either way, Athens is set to get more specific sub-specialists, and possibly a specialty center or two, such as a children’s hospital. community. Meissner, Boehringer Ingelheim, the existing bio-tech already here and the research/academic side of the medical school almost certainly means some ADDITIONAL jobs associated with bio-tech/pharmaceuticals/pathology will come with that package. For anyone familiar with these sectors, how would the culture of those coming into town to fill these jobs differ from the existing manufacturing/government base that currently defines the “archetypes” of people who live here? I imagine their spending patterns, hobbies, and origins/family background might be inherently different in some ways that those that already work full-time in the city.

3. I understand that the liberal, accepting nature of Athens means that gay people are embraced everywhere, but will there ever be a mini-gayborhood, or even a bar cluster somewhere? As a member of the community, and as a Georgia native, I LOVE how much Athens shows up for the girls, gays, and theys. In fact, I would describe Athens’ queer/gay community as “indie/alternative gays”, in the same vein you would see in Decatur, or Asheville. However, this influx will increase the LGBT+ community as well, and since there will be more “permanent” young, urban professionals in that mix, I wonder if Athens will have an explicitly gay “block” of bars/clubs, restaurants, and venues. As much as I equally love the urban, “gay village” scene, I do not want Athens to become Midtown or  the Castro District, but it would be nice to have some more gay “diversity”, other than Church, the townie bars, Athens Pride and Queer Collective, and pop-up drag shows for the day/night. Church, which I understand is problematic, is PACKED wall to wall; why are there no other undergrad/townie hybrid dance/music bars that serve the “quirky”, cosmopolitan crowd? There are dance bars on the other side of the khaki line, and there is Tropical across from Church, but both always have NOTORIOUSLY high demand and exist as the ONLY “types” of these spots/locally. Austin exists as a MUCH more expanded older brother to Athens, but their “downtown” (6th Street, Warehouse District, 2nd Street, Rainey, Red River, SoCo, etc.) has a mixture of “college” bars and more “cosmopolitan” versions, with there being multiple “layers”/“sections” based on your age and subculture/crowd. Again, Athens is (not quite) on the scale of Austin, at least not anytime soon, but I wonder how the already famous nightlife in the city will evolve.

4. By 2030, Athens is set to have most of the projects/developments starting now completed. The waves of new people, including, but not limited to the following: bio-tech workers, tech/healthcare/engineering startup entrepreneurs, researchers, medical students/staff, expanded UGA class sizes, expanded FACULY/STAFF (including the highest paid professors in most states— the ones AT the medical school) more city/county/regional/state/federal employees and additional first responders/teachers to accommodate this growth, trailing partners/spouses for ALL of these, AS WELL AS a burst in  visitors from the larger UGA population, hockey games, and MAJORLY increased hotel space in-town will have ; how does this affect the culture of the town itself? Unlike many, I would say most, mid-size cities and college towns, this area is a “satellite” to Atlanta, and even shares some suburbs. This alone brings people here for no other reason. Just because a city grows DOES NOT mean that it’s core culture/ethos cannot grow with it. If done correctly, the identity can be preserved, and even built upon.

5. What retail and shopping amenities will we likely see? I think Athens’ current retail landscape would easily fill a mid-range mall, or two, but will we see “luxury” retail? Think Apple Store, Aritzia, Nike, Fabletics, some of the mid-ranged designer boutiques, etc… I want to see equally as many locally-owned businesses, but it ultimately is going to be a mixture. If we do see more “upscale”/mall mainstays, where might they be? The (redeveloped) mall? The Connector? Beechwood? Alongside that, what about LA Fitness, Equinox, Whole Foods, and similar businesses? Again, I ALWAYS will aim to support a local business when I can, I have been supporting the new locally-owned bodybuilding gym since before they opened, but I also go to some of these places as well, as I imagine most do, and between the Athens metro and Jackson/Gwinnett, and my LOADED peers fresh out of “Dunwoody/East Cobb/D.C./The Bay”, as well as their equally loaded parents, and the crowds here for game-day/ceremonies/festivals would if not now, in the next decade, could support some Avalon/Perimeter-like stores/restaurants/gyms possibly on a smaller scale, other than the “typical” suburban mix that already exists.

Overall, I think Athens’, although it DEFINITELY has its BS in the urban planning and economic development spheres, does a HELL of a lot better than other towns in the South that simply throw a tantrum when a single-family subdivision comes in. Although not identical, I think Athens’ culture is an unmatched hodgepodge of what draws people to several categories of similar towns: SEC+Southern/Ag culture “State U” (Tuscaloosa, Auburn, Clemson, etc.), bohemian/artsy/musical (Asheville, Portland, Boulder, etc.), “stately/brainy” college town/research hub, (The entirety of the Research Triangle), and “party/bachelorette/major nightlife spot” (Austin, some parts of Atlanta, etc.) These cultural influences are strong, and will likely remain over the next decade. HOWEVER, Athens’ identity as a college town (really college town+, as there is already some “other” social life/cultural scene/development) is seemingly coming to an end. We are entering the are of “mid-sized” U.S. city that happens to have a major university: Knoxville, Durham, and on the MUCH larger scale, Columbus and Austin. Do I want this? In some ways no, and as a student, it is
not really up to me to say “WE should do this or that” or “As a multi-generational resident/property owner/parent of a child in a local school…” but I am curious to see how Athens transitions from its current state to being a “grown-up”, economically-diverse urban/suburban area with an entirely new group of young professionals with little/no UGA affiliation. Athens cannot “refuse” growth, it can only shape it.

(P.S., even after that mouthful of things about to happen, that does not even include the impeding growth of metro Atlanta, the Sun Belt, and “college towns” as a whole!)

"Regarding our terrible ""definition of family"" ordinance:",54,1bxo6mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1bxo6mq/regarding_our_terrible_definition_of_family/,38,2024-04-06 18:29:37,"""At the last hearing \[about the 2003 rental regulation law that would create a massive regulatory framework to uniformly enforce the single family definition ordinance\] homeowner Melissa Link read an eloquent plea that the government consider the effects of this law. She recounted that she has become a homeowner, that she loves her house and her garden and the roommates without whom she could not make her payments. She pleaded with the government to acknowledge that she cannot be a homeowner with only one roommate. She said later that if pushed she will marry one of her roommates and invite the mayor and commission to the wedding.""  
\-Pete McCommons writing for the Flagpole, April 9, 2003.

""This new plan...is based on the present definition of 'family', which is ill-suited for Athens. The mayor and commission and the Friends of Five Points believe that if they run renters out of single-family neighborhoods, nice young couples with 2.3 children, two cars, and a dog (on a leash) will take their places, and single family neighborhoods will be Mom and Dad and Sis and Bud.

This concept of ""family"" completely denies the variety that makes Athens special: homosexual couples don't qualify as a family, and are therefore barred from taking on even one renter; unmarried heterosexual people living together as a family unit but prohibited from renting to a third person; three friends living together in a home owned by one of them or rented from someone else; a young couple sharing their home with a couple of lodgers in order to make their payments; an elderly person who has taken in renters as a means of remaining in his or her home, and the legions of poor families with far more people than the law allows.

All these arrangements are illegal under the present, unenforceable law, and the new law will find them. \[he goes on to describe the 2003 Rental Regulation Ordinance which would quickly be struck down in Superior Court, and which would've cost a hell of a lot of money to run if it had stuck\].All this enforcement, all this bureaucracy, all these fines and penalties to enforce a law that has always been unenforceable. Its like making the speed limit 20 miles an hour all over town to stop kids from drag racing. Nobody's going to obey the law, and it won't stop the racing. If you create a bureaucracy to enforce it, you bring things to a standstill.

While our mayor and commission are reworking the rental law, why not fix the thing that is most broken about it? Why not loosen up this Draconian limitation on the number of people who can live together? Why not at least make it ""family plus two or three unrelated"" like West Lafayette, IN; East Lansing, MI; and State College, PA - three places referenced on the ACC website as examples of rental regulation in college towns.

Easing that limitation would make it possible for more traditional families to buy homes, and it would also allow Athens' many varieties of non-traditional families to continue enriching our town by their diversity.""

Waters is seemingly running as a protest candidate. She hasn’t articulated any particular platform. She hasn’t talked about any core issues facing Athens. Instead, she just comes off as being angry. I was excited to see Mama Sid running at first, but after digging into her campaign, I’ve been disappointed. 

Myers, on the other hand, speaks about issues that are important  to Athens and the east side. She has a clear platform that is cogent, well-articulated, and easy to follow. 

In terms of the candidate who seems to have her finger on the pulse of the community, it‘s pretty clear that Myers is light years ahead of Waters.

Bank Robber “Rabbi” Camden Pace,30,1bvdjr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1bvdjr8/bank_robber_rabbi_camden_pace/,8,2024-04-03 23:49:49,"Many of you are aware that the guy who was tased and arrested at the Mayor and Commissioners meeting last night has a history of legal issues, including a 1998 felony arrest for the armed robbery of a bank. A video has surfaced where he uses this past experience to evaluate the accuracy of a bank robbery in a video game. It's interesting that he displays no regret for his actions. In fact, he appears to take pleasure in recounting the experience. Glad things didn’t escalate further at City Hall. This guys seems dangerous.

These businesses are often struggling to navigate rising costs themselves, from rent to supplier prices, all while striving to provide quality products and services. Instead of placing blame, understanding the broader economic factors at play and supporting local businesses through these challenging times is crucial for fostering a resilient community. "

Tornado watch overnight NW,25,1buflrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1buflrj/tornado_watch_overnight_nw/,4,2024-04-02 21:05:44,"\~Sounds like largely west and north of Athens but...a bit more detail from the NWS;

Issued at 800 PM EDT Tue Apr 2 2024  Tornado Watch 82 has been issued for portions of northwest and west Georgia through 3 AM EDT. As expected, showers and thunderstorms have begun to quickly develop across central and eastern Alabama as the capping inversion erodes. Parameters will become increasingly favorable for severe thunderstorms with a tornado and damaging wind threat over the next several hours as the LLJ strengthens and deeper moisture continues to surge northward. Tornado Watch expansion/additional Tornado Watches are likely tonight as the threat evolves and spreads eastward into the area through early Wednesday morning. 

  \-A potent storm system will produce a severe weather threat beginning this evening and lasting through the overnight hours for portions of north and central Georgia. The severe threat will progress southeastward through the early morning hours on Wednesday. All modes of severe weather will be possible.  -Portions of northwest and western central Georgia (including the metro Atlanta, Columbus, and Macon areas) are under a 10% TOR hatch where strong (greater than EF2) tornadoes will be possible.  -Northwest and western central Georgia are most likely to see strong damaging wind gusts early this evening and through the overnight hours with the damaging wind threat progressing southeast through the early morning hours.  -Large hail (greater than 1 inch) will be possible in storms areawide where the greatest chances will be across far northwest Georgia.  -As the bulk of the storms are expected to move through during the nighttime hours while many people may be sleeping, it is incredibly important to ensure you have more than 1 way to receive warnings this evening.  A nocturnal severe weather threat is expected to play out over portions of north and central Georgia tonight lasting through the early morning hours on Wednesday. The strengthening surface low is currently over central Illinois with the warm front draped over central Indiana and central Ohio, dipping southward into southern Virginia. While generally cloudy skies have been in place today, middle and high clouds have not been as present as previously thought. Breaks in coverage in the low level cumulus field have allowed diurnal surface heating to take place early this afternoon. The extent to which heating may occur will play a role in the surface based available potential energy for thunderstorms that are expected to fire off this afternoon. In this morning\`s 12Z sounding, a significant cap was in place at 850mb. This cap is still evident in this afternoon\`s 18Z sounding, but is expected to erode through the late afternoon in the presence of cold air advection aloft, warming surface temperatures as high as the low 80s across much of north and central Georgia, and moisture return at the lower levels (dewpoints as high as 65 along and south of I-20)."

Thank you for the entertainment you provided. Very satisfying seeing that cop pull out a few seconds later and pull a u-turn to go after you. That was an expensive red light run!!  But very satisfying to see. Thank you as well to the cop for actually doing something about it - I imagine your reaction was similar to mine - did they REALLY just do that??? 

Slow down in the future and maybe pay attention to the light? It was red for a solid couple seconds, and the ambulance was there while it was still just barely green. 

Very glad you didn't hit anyone going probably 50-55 still,, otherwise I'd have had to provide a witness statement. Or possibly file insurance since I was sitting at the turn waiting for the ambulance to go. 

Also, PSA for anyone driving through that intersection if you're not already aware - it's very common for runners to blow through. I almost got t-boned there a couple weeks ago on a protected left to get onto 316. Same direction as the truck today. That person was going much slower than today's absolute track driver, truly impressive speed today, but I'm glad I was paying attention and they finally looked up from....whatever they were doing so we could both stop in time.

"100 Years of Dude, a Special Athens Anniversary",66,1bp35wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1bp35wr/100_years_of_dude_a_special_athens_anniversary/,5,2024-03-27 10:25:31,"This week marks an important anniversary in Athens. It’s no less than the centennial of the first public use of the word “dude” in Athens, 100 years of ""dude."" 

I was reading what remains of the Athens Republique, a Black newspaper that began being published in 1919. The Republique reported news from the Black communities in the area, from Jefferson all the way down to Greensboro, along with national and international news related to the Black struggle. A lot of the paper consisted of social matters: weddings, deaths, and news from the various churches and their congregations. It can be a fairly dry read sometimes, like most papers of the era. 

https://preview.redd.it/080he92iyvqc1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=b606337223e3b1e37dc39184126b80b638188750

Except for this one section where the editor just starts spilling semi-anonymous tea everywhere, just blowing up everyone’s spot. It’s just a section of these little rapid, one or two sentence observations: 

“A certain guy, who works on Washington street, is always getting his business jammed and can’t figure a way out.” 

“I wonder what guy on Hull St., a few steps from the office of the Republique, is always visiting Fairview street.” 

https://preview.redd.it/3pdecdojyvqc1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=263cc61e862f85c67e7c8976793b1a0f037184bf

And then this:

“A dude going to Jeruel Baptist institute thinks he knows Latin better than the teacher, but he never gets it.” 

Dude got ROASTED. 

It’s a little hard to know in what sense “dude” is being used here. The word had begun to come to prominence in the few decades prior to this issue, and while it began as a name for a sharp-dressed dandy, its usage began to shift at roughly the time the Republique was publishing. 

It began as a pejorative, but during this time “dude became synonymous with fellow males in a particular group and began to drop its derisive shading,” according to a linguist in the journal American Speech. And dude came to be “used to denote 'one of us' in certain minority subcultures” during the first half of the 20th century."

Their hope is that a market of for-profit education companies will emerge to chase these $6500 vouchers and market competition will create better schools.

I'm looking to make a big change to my hair, and just want someone who is used to working with thick hair before I make the cut. I've been thinking about trying a Dominican hair salon and I'm willing to travel outside of Athens if needed. Thanks!"

  A group of artists and creatives in Athens get together to make a large paper-mâché model of Technoviking.  This group then walks the Technoviking to through the streets for Wild Rumpus.  There should be fog and obviously the music blasting.

  Anyone interested in making this happen?  Full disclosure, I have neither the time nor the artistic integrity to do this project.  That’s why I’m posting it on Reddit.

I am from Athens, grew up there, and lived there until 2019 when I moved to Florida for work. I have only visited a few times in the past 5 years, and while I lived there I didn’t explore much because I was young and didn’t know much about what there is to see! Keeping this in mind, I will be visiting this May and my boyfriend will be joining me. He has only been to Athens once or twice and he is a huge GA Bulldogs fan, I am too but not nearly as much as he is. I want to show him around the area and have him experience my hometown, but I would love some recommendations on what to do, or go see. The only thing so far I can think of is going to the arches and walking around downtown, but it’s been so long now that I’m not even sure what they have downtown, or which bars are the best to visit as well. I miss The Grill and I’m bummed I can’t take him to eat there since it’s closed! If anyone has any advice or can help recommend some stuff, especially some family friendly stuff since I will have my little sister with us most of our time there as well, but please include both family friendly and non family friendly recs as well! Just trying to plan ahead cause I want to make the most out of our time there since we only have a few days. TIA☺️"

Also, any places where we might be able to use the environment to our advantage/ as a prop (think record shop or coffee shops) would be super cool. 

But other than that, any and all recommendations are welcome as we’re generally not really looking for anything too specific and are open minded!

SB390 is hurting Georgia libraries (update)- please contact before Monday ,41,1blq3vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1blq3vv/sb390_is_hurting_georgia_libraries_update_please/,12,2024-03-23 07:35:22,"The House Higher Education (HHE) Committee will vote on [SB390](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/SB390/2023) on Monday at 2pm.

Here’s my previous post with info on SB390:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/s/KD2sUlVjcP

And other background info: 

The senator who wrote the bill is angry that the current president of the American Library Association said that she was a Marxist, on Twitter. (See line 23 of the bill). By the time this bill passes, that person will no longer be ALA president.

He is also mad that his local home library bought books about POC and LGBTQ individuals. See his interview here:
https://www.wabe.org/a-radical-social-agenda-georgia-gop-senator-on-the-push-to-cut-ties-with-american-library-association/
and
https://www.npr.org/2024/03/01/1234226098/in-georgia-a-bill-to-cut-all-ties-with-the-american-library-association-is-advan

Please consider sending a final message to the members of the HHE Committee letting them know that SB390 is not only unconstitutional, it will harm Georgia's libraries--not the American Library Association. 

[Email the House Higher Education Committee](https://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=22255)

My previous post has sample letters, and here are some other points you could include based on testimony the committee heard in their meeting last Monday:

In the House Higher Education Committee meeting this past Monday, library supporters from across Georgia provided detailed, compelling testimony on SB390 from their perspectives as trustees, Friends group leaders, parents, students, retirees, and employees. They offered evidence of how SB390 would adversely affect your local libraries and NOT the American Library Association.

Here are five follow-up facts from Monday’s hearing:

1. SB390’s targeted ban on a contractor over protected free speech raises significant doubts of the bill’s constitutionality. The Supreme Court has held that the Free Speech Clause bars the government from retaliating against independent contractors because of the contractor’s speech. Further, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine protects grant recipients as well as employees and contractors. 

2. Georgia would be the first state in the Union to prohibit participation in ALA via legislation. Other states that have chosen to prohibit organizational membership in ALA–Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming–have done so ONLY via their state library’s governing boards, not through statewide legislation affecting all libraries. The Georgia Public Library Service, our state library, dropped its ALA membership several years ago in response to budget cuts and is not currently an ALA member.

3. The inclusion of “ALA affiliates” in SB390 would restrict library staff participation in not one, or even a dozen, different organizations, but 91 unique, professional library organizations: 27 national affiliates, 56 state and regional library association chapters, and 8 ALA divisions.

4. Passage of SB390 would make librarians the ONLY profession in Georgia to have their professional association banned. Not only is this measure exclusionary in the extreme, it sets a grim precedent for the future of engaged and hardworking Georgians in all professions. 

5. “Reparative description” neither erases nor obfuscates history. It is a review process led by trained, experienced archivists and librarians to revise antiquated, outdated, or offensive descriptions of historical content, and does not change the nature of the original records themselves. Such revisions can include medical and scientific terminology–such as the outdated “Leprosy” for the more current “Hansen’s disease”--as well as terms for race, sexuality, and identity, such as substituting “people with disabilities” for “invalids.” This common practice demonstrates nothing about the ALA itself or its leadership.

The ALA is the oldest and by far the largest library association in the world. Georgia’s libraries are in no way required to participate in the ALA and are completely independent in their governance, finances, and outlook. Librarians have the responsibility and mandate to operate libraries based on local determination of what best serves the communities they know and love. 

You heard clearly from patrons and supporters that Georgia’s libraries are an extraordinary gift and that undue influence from the legislature is unwelcome. I respectfully request that you continue to support our libraries by opposing this unnecessary legislation.
